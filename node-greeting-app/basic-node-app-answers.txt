1. What is a Node module?
  a set of functions to include in your app that acts much like a javascript library. It's code that is grouped together for the purposes of sharing and reuse.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
  exports is not returned by require() and is just a convenience variable so module authors can write less code. module.exports is the object reference that gets returned from.

3. Why is using exports recommended?
  exports is recommended because it will not overwrite whatever you have assigned to module.exports because exports is a reference to module.exports and cannot reassign the actual object module.exports. exports is recommended unless you are trying to make module be a specific object type
